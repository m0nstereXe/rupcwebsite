            <h2>Contest Structure</h2>
            <h3>ICPC-Style Format</h3>
            <p>Teams of three students will collaborate on a single computer to solve algorithmic programming problems. While we allow open internet access for documentation and reference, communication with anyone outside your team is strictly prohibited during the contest.</p>
            
            <h3>Problem Format</h3>
            <p>Contestants will tackle 12-15 problems of varying difficulty. Each problem includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem description with background story</li>
                <li>Input/output format specification</li>
                <li>Constraints on input size and values</li>
                <li>Sample test cases with explanations</li>
                <li>Hidden test cases used for judging</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Judging</h3>
            <p>Solutions are submitted to an automated judge (codeforces) that runs your code against a set of test cases. Your program must solve all test cases correctly within the time limit to receive points. Teams are ranked first by number of problems solved, then by total time taken (including penalty time for incorrect submissions).</p>

            <h2>Rutgers Competitive Programming Club (RUCP)</h2>
            <p>We are the competitive programming club at Rutgers University and the organizers of this contest. Our club is dedicated to fostering problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking through programming competitions.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout the semester, we host:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Educational lectures on competitive programming topics</li>
                <li>Practice contests and problem-solving sessions</li>
                <li>Team practice for competitions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Our members regularly compete in prestigious programming competitions including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)</li>
                <li>MIT Informatics Tournament (MITIT)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We're a community of students who love problem solving and having fun! Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/8FFPUr2ESP" target="_blank">Discord server</a> to say hi :3</p>
